# Commit Standards

This project has some some basic standards for the `git` commit messages.

1. Commits should follow the 50/72 rule (max 50 columns for the title, 72 columns
   per description line<sup>[[1]](#exception)</sup>)
2. Commits should be small, granular, and independent.
3. Commit titles should be written in imperative, present-tense
4. Commit messages should, where clarification is beneficial, describe the
  "What", "Where", and "Why"

Although not requires, please also consider prefixing your commit titles with
an [emoji key](#moji-key), as listed below, to help categorize commit messages.
